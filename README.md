# Gang of Four PGC
This repo is a language agnostic compilation of examples of Gang of Four (GoF)
design patterns. Make a folder for the design patterns you wish to cover in class and use whichever
language you please.

## GoF design patterns

Currently only the GoF design patterns are covered. The GoF design patterns can
be found [here](gof.md). 

## Other design patterns
If you wish to cover design patterns outside of those
created by GoF, describe them in a separate Markdown document and link it here.
